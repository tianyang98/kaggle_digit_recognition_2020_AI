# kaggle_digit_recognition_2020_AI
course project


This is a course project I did on 2019 Fall Artificial Intelligence. 

The professor collected the handwritten digit samples from 400+ student on the class and let us design the maching learning
algorithms for digit recoginition using this new dataset and MNIST handwritten digit database.

For higher efficiency, I chose Neural Network as the main idea and used Keras to complete. MNIST handwritten digit database and
part of the Fall 2019 AI handwritten digit dataset were used as training data, while the rest of Fall 2019 AI handwritten digit 
dataset was used as validation data.

Finally, the accuracy is top 28%.
